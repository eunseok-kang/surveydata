#I chose the congress dataset due to recent events happening around us today. One big issue is the abortion law, and how grown women have rights to their child taken away from them. Aside from this, there are other recent issues/current events, and that is why I chose the congress dataset. I wanted to see whether the number of congress within history had an impact on the age of the members and representatives of congress. The data showed that the overall age average did not increase nor decrease, and aside from a few outliers, the average age of all congress members stayed relatively the same throughout history at the ages of 30-75.
